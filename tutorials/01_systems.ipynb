    "The Flight.jl package is built upon a hierarchical, causal modeling paradigm. At its core lies the parametric `System` type, which represents a physical system with continuous and (optionally) discrete dynamics.  Every `System` has a continuous state `x`. It may also have an external input `u`, an output `y` and a discrete state `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `System`'s continuous dynamics are described by a differential equation of the form:\n",

    "A concrete `System` type is specified by means a subtype of the abstract `SystemDescriptor` type. This `SystemDescriptor` serves a dual purpose:\n",
    "1. It holds the values for all the (immutable) parameters that characterize a specific instance of that `System` type.\n",
    "2. It provides a dispatch mechanism for extending the set of functions that initialize the `System`'s variables: `x`, `u`, `y` and `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify this, let us consider a simple example: a [mass-spring-damper][1] model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response of this system is determined by its mass $m$, its spring constant $k$ and its damping constant $c$. Its continuous dynamics are given by the differential equation:\n",

    "Of these, $\\omega_n$ and $\\zeta$ are constant parameters, $v$ and $p$ make up the models's continuous state, and $f$ is an external input. As outputs, we may (arbitrarily) select $p$, $v$ and the acceleration $a = \\dot{v}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In its vanilla version, the mass-spring-damper model has no need for discrete states. To illustrate a use case for `s`, let's add a twist to the model: we would like the damper to engage only after the system has been in motion for more than $\\Delta t_d$ seconds, and disengage again whenever it has been stationary for more than $\\Delta t_d$ seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior can be implemented by a simple finite state machine that keeps track of three variables: the damper's state (engaged or disengaged), the last time the system started moving, and the last time it stopped. These clearly represent states in the model, but unlike $v$ or $p$, their evolution is not described by a differential equation. Instead, they are all updated at discrete time steps. Therefore, they belong in the `System`'s discrete state `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification also requires two additional parameters: the damper switching interval $\\Delta t_d$, and a velocity threshold $v_{\\epsilon}$, below which we will consider the system to be stationary.\n",
