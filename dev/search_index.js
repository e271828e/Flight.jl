Here, keeping consistency with X-Plane's visuals is no longer a concern, so we can stick to the default constructors:\n\nusing Flight\nworld = SimpleWorld(Cessna172Xv1(), SimpleAtmosphere(), HorizontalTerrain()) #zero-MSL terrain\n\nInspecting SimpleWorld's type hierarchy reveals that it is a concrete subtype of the abstract type ModelDefinition:\n\nusing InteractiveUtils\nsupertypes(SimpleWorld)\n\nAn instance of a ModelDefinition subtype can be thought of as a blueprint specifying how a particular Model should be built. To instantiate that Model, we pass the ModelDefinition object to the Model constructor:\n\nmdl = Model(world)\n\nLet's take a look at our Model's properties:\n\npropertynames(mdl)\n\nTo make sense of what comes next, it is useful to understand what each one of these represents:\n\nx (continuous state): A vector containing Model states that evolve continuously over time. It is updated by the Simulation's ODE integrator.\nẋ (continuous state derivative): A vector containing the time derivative of x.\ns (discrete state): A mutable type holding Model states that change only at specific moments in time.\nu (input): A mutable type holding the Model's input variables. These are assigned either by a parent Model or an external source.\ny (output): An immutable type holding all the relevant results from the Model's computations. These may be used by a parent Model or saved in the Simulation's log.\nt (time): A reference to the current simulation time.\nΔt (sampling period): The time interval for the Model's periodic updates.\nparameters: A NamedTuple containing values that characterize a specific Model instance.\nsubmodels: A NamedTuple of child Models that represent components of the parent Model.\n\nThe remaining properties are entries from parameters and submodels. These may be accessed directly via dot notation:\n\n@show keys(mdl.parameters)\n@show keys(mdl.submodels)\n@show mdl.atmosphere\nnothing #hide\n\nA submodel can have submodels of its own:\n\n@show keys(mdl.atmosphere.submodels)\n@show mdl.atmosphere.sl\nnothing #hide\n\nThus, a complex Model may be made up of multiple, hierarchically arranged components, each one of them itself a Model. To visualize a Model's hierarchy, you can use the print_tree function:\n\nusing AbstractTrees\nprint_tree(mdl; maxdepth = 10)\n\nYou can also inspect a specific property across a Model's hierarchy. For example, to view the input u for mdl.aircraft.vehicle.systems and every node underneath:\n\nprint_tree(mdl.aircraft.vehicle.systems, :u; maxdepth = 10);","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/tutorial02/tutorial02/#Simulating-an-Elevator-Doublet","page":"Headless Flight Simulation","title":"Simulating an Elevator Doublet","text":"Our plan for this section is as follows:\n\nCreate a Simulation.\nInitialize the aircraft in a trimmed state.\nApply an elevator doublet by setting the appropriate inputs and stepping the Simulation manually.\nLet the Simulation run to completion.\nExtract and plot some logged variables to observe the aircraft's response.\n\nLet's begin by creating a Simulation from our Model:\n\nsim = Simulation(mdl; dt = 0.02, t_end = 60)\n\ntip: From a ModelDefinition\nYou can also pass a ModelDefinition object directly to the Simulation constructor. In that case, the Model is instantiated automatically under the hood:Simulation(world; dt = 0.02, t_end = 60)\nnothing #hide\n\nThe Model is now stored within the Simulation, and it can be accesed at any time for inspection or manipulation:\n\n@assert mdl === sim.mdl\n\nNext, let's define a default trim condition and use it to initialize the Simulation:\n\ninit_air = C172.TrimParameters()\ninit!(sim, init_air)\n\nYou may recall how during interactive simulation we used the Aircraft > Avionics GUI panel to control the aircraft. That panel belongs to the mdl.aircraft.avionics node, which provides the flight control laws for the Cessna172Xv1 aircraft. This node has two children:\n\nprint_tree(mdl.aircraft.avionics)\n\nAs you might guess, these implement respectively the aircraft's longitudinal and lateral control laws. The control inputs under the Longitudinal Control section of the Avionics GUI panel mapped to mdl.aircraft.avionics.lon's input struct. Here, we will be writing to this struct directly. Let's retrieve it from the model hierarchy:\n\nu_lon = mdl.aircraft.avionics.lon.u\nnothing #hide\n\nTo inspect its fields, we can use the shf helper function:\n\nshf(u_lon)\n\nNotice how the trim function, invoked within the previous init! call, has already set the primary control inputs (throttle_axis and elevator_axis) to the values required by the trimmed flight condition. Also, the longitudinal control mode input (lon_ctl_mode_req) is set to its direct value. This bypasses all control loops, preserving the aircraft's natural dynamic response, which is what we want in this case.\n\nLet's first advance the Simulation a few seconds without perturbing the trim equilibrium. To do so, we use the step! method, which essentially wraps the one from DifferentialEquations.jl's integrator interface.\n\nstep!(sim, 5) #advance the simulation 5 seconds\n\nTo apply the elevator doublet, we can either modify the elevator_axis input or, more conveniently, use elevator_offset instead. Here's how to do it:\n\nu_lon.elevator_offset = 0.1 #10 percent positive offset\nstep!(sim, 2) #advance 2 seconds\nu_lon.elevator_offset = -0.1 #10 percent negative offset\nstep!(sim, 2) #advance 2 seconds\nu_lon.elevator_offset = 0.0 #return to trim position\nnothing #hide\n\nAfter this, we don't need to interact with the Simulation any further, so we can let it run to completion:\n\nSim.run!(sim)\nnothing #hide\n\nNow let's get some results.\n\nA Simulation's log consists of the timestamped values of its root Model's output y. The easiest way to retrieve and handle this data is through the TimeSeries type:\n\nts = TimeSeries(sim)\n\ntip: Controlling logging behavior\nBy default, the Model's outputs are saved at every integration step. You can use the saveat keyword argument to control logging behavior:Simulation(mdl; dt = 0.02, t_end = 60, saveat = 0.1) #every 0.1s\nSimulation(mdl; dt = 0.02, t_end = 60, saveat = [0:0.1:10..., 11:1:60...]) #specific instants\nnothing #hide\n\nA TimeSeries object lets you inspect the properties of its underlying data type, and generate another TimeSeries object for any of these properties. This is particularly convenient when dealing with large, deeply nested types, as Model outputs often are. Let's see a few examples:\n\n@show propertynames(ts)\n@show propertynames(ts.aircraft)\n@show propertynames(ts.aircraft.vehicle)\nnothing #hide\n\nts_kin = ts.aircraft.vehicle.kinematics\nts_sys = ts.aircraft.vehicle.systems\nts_ω = ts_kin.ω_wb_b #angular velocity, Wander frame to Body frame (rad/s)\nts_θ = ts_kin.e_nb.θ #pitch angle, NED frame to Body frame (rad)\nts_α = ts_sys.aero.α #angle of attack (rad)\nts_el_cmd = ts_sys.act.elevator.cmd[4 .<= get_time(ts) .< 10] #elevator command\nts_el_pos = ts_sys.act.elevator.pos[4 .<= get_time(ts) .< 10] #elevator position\nnothing #hide\n\nPlots.jl recipes are available for many common TimeSeries subtypes, so plotting is usually straightforward:\n\nimport Plots\nusing LaTeXStrings\nPlots.default(:size, (900, 600))\nPlots.default(:left_margin, 16Plots.px)\nnothing #hide\n\n#TimeSeries{<:Ranged} recipe\nPlots.plot(ts_el_cmd; plot_title=\"Elevator Response\", label = \"Command\")\nPlots.plot!(ts_el_pos; label = \"Position\")\n\n#TimeSeries{<:AbstractVector{<:Real}} recipe\nPlots.plot(ts_ω; plot_title=\"Angular Velocity\", ylabel=L\"$\\omega \\ (rad/s)$\")\n\n#TimeSeries{Real} recipe\nPlots.plot(ts_α; plot_title=\"AoA vs Pitch Angle\", ylabel=L\"$\\alpha, \\ \\theta \\ (rad)$\", label=\"AoA\")\nPlots.plot!(ts_θ; label = \"Pitch Angle\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition to individual TimeSeries recipes, you can use the make_plots function to generate a set of typically useful plots from a specific TimeSeries subtype. Here are some examples:\n\nplots_kin = make_plots(ts.aircraft.vehicle.kinematics)\n\nplots_kin[:vχγ]\n\nplots_dyn = make_plots(ts.aircraft.vehicle.dynamics)\n\nplots_dyn[:f_c_c]\n\nplots_air = make_plots(ts.aircraft.vehicle.airflow)\n\nplots_air[:airspeed_M_q]","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/tutorial02/tutorial02/#Automating-Model-Control-With-User-Callbacks","page":"Headless Flight Simulation","title":"Automating Model Control With User Callbacks","text":"In some cases, rather than stepping through the Simulation and assigning Model inputs at each stop, you might want to define and encapsulate the control logic in advance, and then let the Simulation run uninterrupted from start to finish.\n\nThis is where user callbacks come in. These are custom functions with the signature user_callback!(::Model) called by the Simulation after every integration step. The main purpose of user callbacks is to automate Model input management.\n\nwarning: Modifying Model State\nUser callbacks should only be used to assign Model inputs; do not modify a Model's continuous or discrete states within a user callback unless you really know what you're doing.\n\nLet's define a user callback implementing our elevator doublet logic:\n\nuser_callback! = function(mdl::Model)\n    t = mdl.t[] #mdl.t is a RefValue, we need to dereference it\n    u_lon = mdl.aircraft.avionics.lon.u\n    if 5 <= t < 7\n        u_lon.elevator_offset = 0.1\n    elseif 7 <= t < 9\n        u_lon.elevator_offset = -0.1\n    else\n        u_lon.elevator_offset = 0\n    end\nend\n\nAll we need to do now is create a new Simulation with this function definition as a keyword argument, initialize it as before, and run it:\n\nsim = Simulation(mdl; dt = 0.02, t_end = 60, user_callback!)\ninit!(sim, init_air)\nSim.run!(sim)\nnothing #hide\n\nAs expected, we get exactly the same result:\n\nts = TimeSeries(sim)\nts_el = ts.aircraft.vehicle.systems.act.elevator[4 .<= get_time(ts) .< 10]\nPlots.plot(ts_el.cmd; plot_title=\"Elevator Response\", label = \"Command\")\nPlots.plot!(ts_el.pos; label = \"Position\")","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/tutorial01/tutorial01/#Interactive-Flight-Simulation","page":"Interactive Flight Simulation","title":"Interactive Flight Simulation","text":"This tutorial shows how to set up and run an interactive flight simulation.

If you happen to have the full version, you can use it instead. Since we will be running X-Plane simply as an external visualization tool, we only need to set up a few things; for further help, check out the X-Plane 12 manual.\n\nnote: No X-Plane?\nIf you can't run X-Plane 12 (which might happen for instance if you have an Intel integrated graphics chip), you can skip this section. Your visuals will be limited to the built-in GUI, but everything else should still work.\n\nFrom the main menu, click on New Flight. Select the Cessna Skyhawk as your aircraft and Salzburg (LOWS) as your initial location. Start the flight.\n\n(Image: X-Plane 12 New Flight Screen)\n\nOnce X-Plane is done loading, move the mouse to the top of the screen to bring up the menu bar. Click on the Settings icon and go the Network tab. Make sure Accept incoming connections is enabled. Then, under the UDP Ports section, check the Port we receive on (legacy) value. The default is 49000, but you can use a different one if you need to. Finally, if you are running X-Plane on a different machine than your Julia session, note its IP address.\n\n(Image: X-Plane 12 Network Settings)\n\nNow go to the Graphics tab.

However, this is just for aesthetics, since our simulation's physics are totally independent from X-Plane's terrain mesh. This disconnect will become apparent as soon as the aircraft starts rolling down the runway.\n\nNow, let's create our simulated world:\n\naircraft = Cessna172Xv1()\natmosphere = SimpleAtmosphere()\nterrain = HorizontalTerrain(h_LOWS15)\nworld = SimpleWorld(aircraft, atmosphere, terrain)\nnothing # hide\n\nSimpleAtmosphere provides a basic, ISA-based atmosphere with customizable sea-level conditions and wind velocity. HorizontalTerrain represents a surface with constant orthometric elevation, which we have set to our value for the beginning of runway 15. Finally, Cessna172Xv1 is a hypothetical customization of a Cessna 172S. It replaces the reversible actuation system on the base model with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system, which we will leverage in this tutorial. Note that this aircraft does not aim to replicate the internals or interface of any specific real-world autopilot. Its purpose is simply to illustrate how the Flight.jl framework may be used to design, implement and test complex control architectures.\n\nWe can now build our simulation:\n\nsim = Simulation(world; dt = 0.01) #specifies a suitable integration step size\nnothing # hide\n\nUnder the hood, this call turns our SimpleWorld instance into a Model object, which is what the Simulation will actually interact with. The Model type is central to the Flight.jl framework, and we will look into it further in future tutorials.\n\nNext, we instantiate an X-Plane 12 control interface and attach it to the simulation. This will allow the simulation to disable X-Plane's physics engine and periodically send our aircraft's state for X-Plane to display:\n\nxp = XPlane12Control()\nSim.attach!(sim, xp)\nnothing # hide\n\nnote: X-Plane UDP Settings\nThe default XPlane12Control constructor assumes X-Plane 12 is running on your local machine and listening on port 49000. If this is not the case, you will need to provide the appropriate IP address and/or port (discussed in the X-Plane setup section) as keyword arguments. For example:using Flight # hide\nusing Sockets #bring IPv4 into scope\nxp = XPlane12Control(address = IPv4(\"192.168.1.2\"), port = 49001)\nnothing # hide\n\nFlight.jl provides a generic joystick interface built on SDL2_jll. Currently, Thrustmaster's T.16000M and VKBSim's Gladiator NXT Evo are the only supported models. If you happen to own one of these, you can plug it in now and do the following:\n\nfor joystick in update_connected_joysticks()\n    Sim.attach!(sim, joystick)\nend\n\nOtherwise, don't worry; in this tutorial we will let the SAS and autopilot modes handle most of the flying for us. This will make it relatively easy to control the aircraft through the GUI.\n\nThe last step is to define a suitable initial condition. For on-ground initialization, we can do that by specifying the aircraft's frame kinematic state:\n\ninit_gnd = KinInit(;\n    location = loc_LOWS15, #2D location\n    h = h_LOWS15 + C172.Δh_to_gnd, #altitude, as an offset with respect to terrain elevation\n    q_nb = REuler(ψ_LOWS15, 0, 0), #attitude with respect to NED frame, as Euler angles\n    ω_wb_b = zeros(3), #angular velocity with respect to local tangent frame, aircraft frame coordinates\n    v_eb_n = zeros(3), #Earth-relative velocity, NED frame coordinates\n    ) |> C172.Init\nnothing # hide\n\nThen, we assign it as:\n\ninit!(sim, init_gnd)","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/tutorial01/tutorial01/#Running-the-Simulation","page":"Interactive Flight Simulation","title":"Running the Simulation","text":"Now we can finally run the simulation:\n\nSim.run!(sim; gui = true)\n\nAfter a few seconds, the simulation will start, and a new OS window containing the built-in GUI will open:\n\n(Image: Default GUI)\n\nThe Simulation Control panel lets you pause or resume the simulation, and set its pace relative to wall clock time. To abort the simulation, simply close the GUI window.\n\nThe other panel is specific to the simulated Model. A complex Model like ours comprises a hierarchy of components. Each component is itself a Model, and it typically defines its own GUI panel, which can be accessed from that of its parent. Feel free to explore the GUI to get a picture of the underlying component hierarchy and discover different ways of interacting with the simulation.\n\ntip: GUI State\nGUI panels can be moved, resized, tiled, docked or grouped as tabs. Try to find the layout that works best for you. GUI state is saved in a file named imgui.ini, which is automatically created in the project's root folder.  Deleting this file will restore the GUI to its default state.\n\nLet's get back to X-Plane for a moment. You should now see the aircraft sitting on the runway with the engine stopped. This indicates that the X-Plane interface was set up properly and our simulation has taken control of the visuals.\n\n(Image: X-Plane 12 Simulation Started)\n\nnote: X-Plane 12 Demo Time Limit\nAs of this writing, the X-Plane 12 demo is time-limited to 60 minutes. After that, an on-screen pop-up will appear. To get rid of it, you can simply restart X-Plane and click on Resume Last Flight. Then, reset the simulation and run it again:init!(sim, init_gnd)\nSim.run!(sim; gui = true)\n\nNow return to the GUI and navigate to Aircraft > Vehicle > Systems > Power Plant > Engine. Expand the Control header and press the Engine Start button. To confirm the engine is running, you can check the engine parameters under the Data header.\n\n(Image: GUI Engine Start)\n\nIf you now try to drag the Throttle slider, you will notice it does not move. The reason is that, on this aircraft, throttle is controlled through the fly-by-wire flight control system.\n\nYou can find the flight control system's interface under Aircraft > Avionics. Expand its Longitudinal Control and Lateral Control sections. The longitudinal control channel computes throttle and elevator commands. The lateral control channel computes aileron and rudder commands. Both are initialized in Direct mode, wherein each actuator command is simply the sum of its corresponding Axis and Offset values. With Direct mode active on both channels, you are essentially flying the base Cessna 172S model, except for the additional actuator dynamics.\n\nTry moving the control surfaces using the Axis and Offset inputs, and observe the result on the GUI's numerical displays or an external X-Plane camera. When you are done, reset all values back to zero.\n\nnote: Joystick Override\nIf you have a joystick attached, the Axis sliders will be overridden by the corresponding joystick axes.\n\ntip: Keyboard Input\nTo assign a precise value to a control slider, use Ctrl+Click (on Windows) or Cmd+click (on Mac) to enable keyboard input.\n\nUnder Longitudinal Control, select the SAS mode. In this mode, throttle and elevator inputs are fed to a longitudinal stability compensator, which computes the actual throttle and elevator actuator commands. This modifies the natural short-period and phugoid modes, providing a smoother, more stable pitch response. When clicked, the button will turn amber, indicating the mode is now on standby; it will engage automatically upon lift off.\n\nUnder Lateral Control, select the SAS mode. In this mode, aileron and rudder inputs are fed to a lateral stability compensator, which computes the actual aileron and rudder actuator commands. This improves the aircraft's Dutch roll response and stabilizes its naturally unstable spiral mode.\n\nCurrently, the GUI does not have a graphical instrument panel. Instead, the Flight Data section provides readouts for all essential variables. This will be particularly useful if you're running this tutorial without X-Plane.\n\n(Image: Take-Off GUI)\n\nThat is all we really need to set up for take off. We won't bother with flap settings, rotation or even keeping the aircraft centered on the runway (which, as far as our simulation is concerned, doesn't really exist!). When you're ready, just set the Throttle Axis all the way to 1 and let the aircraft accelerate and lift off on its own.\n\nOnce airborne, you will see the previously selected SAS modes turn from amber to green. Let the aircraft climb for a while to give yourself some clearance. Then, spend some time flying with the SAS modes enabled. When you feel comfortable with the controls, try switching back and forth between the Direct and SAS longitudinal modes, and compare the aircraft's response to elevator input. You can do the same with the Direct and SAS lateral modes to compare aileron and rudder responses, but mind the spiral mode instability!\n\ntip: Crashing\nIf the landing gear model detects a crash, it will throw an exception and the simulation will abort. No worries, just reset it and have another go.\n\nNext, try the EAS + Pitch Rate mode. This mode combines an autothrottle loop with a pitch rate loop built on top of the longitudinal SAS. Activating this mode will disable all Throttle and Elevator inputs and enable the EAS and Pitch Rate commands. The numerical readout to the right of each command slider shows the current value of its target variable. Try changing the EAS command and observe the response. Then, experiment with the Pitch Rate command. While doing so, keep in mind that an arbitrary pitch rate cannot be sustained indefinitely!\n\nnote: Mode Transitions\nWhen a new autopilot mode is engaged, its command variables are automatically set to their current values to provide a smooth transition. The exception are Pitch Rate and Roll Rate commands, which are always initialized to zero.\n\nWhen you are done, enable the EAS + Altitude Hold mode and set the EAS command to 50 m/s. This will hold your altitude throughout the next steps.\n\nIf you have attempted any turns so far, you may have noticed that the Roll/Yaw SAS mode does not provide automatic turn coordination. For this, you can use one of the higher level lateral modes, all of which track sideslip angle commands. Go ahead and enable the Bank Angle + Sideslip mode. Set the Sideslip Angle command to zero. Then, initiate a turn with the Bank Angle command, and notice how the sideslip angle is indeed held during the turn.\n\nFinally, enable the Course Angle + Sideslip mode. Set the Course Angle to 0 and let the aircraft turn to intercept it. Then, open the Atmosphere > Wind panel. Use the East slider to add some crosswind. Notice how the aircraft turns into the wind, settling on the appropriate heading to maintain the commanded course angle, while also tracking the commanded sideslip angle.\n\n(Image: Course Tracking GUI)\n\nFeel free to explore the remaining control modes on your own. One final hint before wrapping up: if the take-off sequence starts getting tedious, you can skip it entirely by using the trim functionality to initialize the aircraft in flight. Here's how to do it:\n\ninit_air = C172.TrimParameters(;\n    Ob = Geographic(loc_LOWS15, h_LOWS15 + 500), #500 m above runway 15\n    EAS = 50.0, #equivalent airspeed (m/s)\n    ψ_nb = ψ_LOWS15, #runway heading (rad)\n    γ_wb_n = 0.0, #wind-relative flight path angle (rad)\n    ψ_wb_dot = 0.0, #turn rate (rad/s)\n    flaps = 0.0, #flaps position (0 to 1)\n    fuel_load = 0.5, #normalized fuel load (0 to 1)\n)\ninit!(sim, init_air)","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"using Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Flight\")\n\nwarning: Configuring Julia for Multithreading\nDuring simulation, Flight.jl uses multithreading to concurrently handle the simulation loop, the built-in GUI and any attached I/O devices.
