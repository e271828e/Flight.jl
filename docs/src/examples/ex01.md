# Interactive Simulation

This example shows how to set up and run an interactive aircraft simulation. You will be able to
control it through the built-in GUI and, optionally, use the free X-Plane 12 demo for 3D
visualization.

### Setting Up X-Plane 12

Download, install and run the [X-Plane 12 demo](https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/try-it/). If you
happen to have the full version, you can use it instead. Since we will be using X-Plane simply as an
external visualization tool, we only need to set up a few things; for further help, check out the
[X-Plane 12 manual](https://www.x-plane.com/manuals/desktop/).

!!! note "Without X-Plane"

    If you can't run X-Plane 12 (which might happen for instance if you have an Intel integrated
    graphics chip), you can skip this section. Your visuals will be limited to the built-in GUI, but
    everything else should still work.

From the main menu, click on *New Flight*. Select the Cessna Skyhawk as your aircraft and Salzburg
(LOWS) as your initial location. Start the flight.

![X-Plane 12 New Flight Screen](xp12_new_flight.png)

To switch to an external camera, press Shift+4. Right click and drag to rotate the view and
use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. To return to the cockpit camera, press Shift+0.

![X-Plane 12 Settings Icon](xp12_settings_icon.png)

Move the mouse to the top of the screen to bring up the menu bar. Click on the *Settings* icon and
go the *Network* tab. Make sure *Accept incoming connections* is enabled. Then, under the *UDP
Ports* section, check the *Port we receive on (legacy)* value. The default is 49000, but you can use
a different one if you need to. Finally, if you are running X-Plane on a different machine than your
Julia session, note its IP address.

![X-Plane 12 Network Settings](xp12_network_settings.png)

Now go to the *Graphics* tab. Unless you have a multi-monitor setup, you will probably want to run
X-Plane in windowed mode. This will allow you to keep it on screen along with the ```Flight.jl```
built-in GUI. To enable windowed mode, select *Windowed Simulator* in the *Monitor usage* drop-down.

![X-Plane 12 Graphics Settings](xp12_graphics_settings.png)

You might also want to experiment with the quality settings until you achieve a comfortable
framerate. To display the framerate on screen, go to the *Data Output* tab, find the *Framerate*
entry in the table and enable the *Show in cockpit* option.

This concludes our X-Plane setup, now let's move on to Julia.


### Setting Up the ```Flight.jl``` Simulation

!!! warning "Configuring Julia for Multithreading"

    When running an interactive simulation, ```Flight.jl``` uses multithreading to concurrently handle
    the simulation loop, the built-in GUI and any attached I/O devices. Therefore, to work through this
    example you will need to start Julia with multiple threads enabled. You can find out how to do this in
    the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/). However, if you are using the
    Julia extension for VS Code, the easiest way is to add the following entry to your
    ```settings.json```:

    ```json
    "julia.additionalArgs": [
        "--threads=auto",
    ],
    ```

    This should work well for most modern CPUs. If you have issues running the
    simulation, try setting the number of threads manually to 4 or higher:

    ```json
    "julia.additionalArgs": [
        "--threads=4",
    ],
    ```

Let's begin by initializing the package:
```@example ex01
using Flight
```

Next, we need to define a 2D location and orthometric elevation for the beginning of Salzburg airport's
runway 15, as well as the runway's geographic heading:
```@example ex01
loc_LOWS15 = LatLon(ϕ = deg2rad(47.80433), λ = deg2rad(12.997))
h_LOWS15 = HOrth(427.2)
ψ_LOWS15 = deg2rad(157)
nothing # hide
```

!!! note "A Caveat On X-Plane Visuals"

    The above values will result in X-Plane displaying the aircraft properly positioned and aligned
    on the runway centerline at the beginning of the simulation. However, this is just for aesthetics,
    since our simulation's physics are totally independent from X-Plane's terrain mesh. This disconnect will
    become apparent as soon as the aircraft starts rolling down the runway.

Our simulated world will consist of an aircraft, an atmospheric model and a terrain model:

```@example ex01
aircraft = Cessna172Xv1()
atmosphere = SimpleAtmosphere()
terrain = HorizontalTerrain(h_LOWS15)
world = SimpleWorld(aircraft, atmosphere, terrain)
nothing # hide
```

The ```Cessna172Xv1``` aircraft is a hypothetical customization of a Cessna 172S. It replaces the
reversible actuation system on the base model with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system,
which we will leverage in this example. Note that this aircraft does not aim to replicate the
internals or interface of any specific real-world autopilot. Its main purpose is simply to
illustrate how the ```Flight.jl``` framework can be used to design, implement and test complex
control architectures.

```SimpleAtmosphere``` provides a basic,
[ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere)-based atmospheric model with
customizable sea-level conditions and wind velocity. ```HorizontalTerrain``` is a terrain model with
constant orthometric elevation, which we have set to our previous value for the beginning of runway
15\.

Now we can create our simulation:
```@example ex01
sim = Simulation(world; dt = 0.01) #specifies a suitable integration step size
nothing # hide
```

Under the hood, this call uses our ```SimpleWorld``` instance as a blueprint to construct a
```Model```, which is what the ```Simulation``` will actually interact with. The ```Model``` type
is central to the ```Flight.jl``` framework, and we will look into it further in future examples.

Next, we instantiate an X-Plane 12 control interface and attach it to the simulation. This will
allow the simulation to disable X-Plane's physics engine and periodically send our aircraft's state
for X-Plane to display:
```@example ex01
xp = XPlane12Control()
Sim.attach!(sim, xp)
nothing # hide
```

!!! note "X-Plane UDP Settings"

    The default ```XPlane12Control``` constructor assumes X-Plane 12 is running on your local machine
    and listening on port 49000. If this is not the case, you will need to provide the appropriate IP
    address and/or port (discussed in the X-Plane setup section) as keyword arguments. For example:

    ```@example
    using Flight # hide
    using Sockets #bring IPv4 into scope
    xp = XPlane12Control(address = IPv4("192.168.1.2"), port = 49001)
    nothing # hide
    ```

```Flight.jl``` provides basic joystick support via [SDL2_jll]
(https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/SDL2_jll.jl). Currently, Thrustmaster's T.16000M is the only
implemented model. Adding support for other joysticks should be relatively straightforward, but we
will not get into it here. If you happen to have a T.16000M available, you can plug it in now and do
the following:

```@example ex01
for joystick in update_connected_joysticks()
    isa(joystick, Joysticks.T16000M) && Sim.attach!(sim, joystick)
end
```

Otherwise, don't worry; in this example, we will let the SAS and autopilot modes handle most of
the flying for us. This will make it relatively easy to control the aircraft through the GUI.

The last step is to define a suitable initial condition. For on-ground initialization, we can do
that by specifying the aircraft's frame kinematic state:

```@example ex01
init_gnd = KinInit(;
    loc = loc_LOWS15, #2D location
    h = h_LOWS15 + C172.Δh_to_gnd, #altitude, as an offset with respect to terrain elevation
    q_nb = REuler(ψ_LOWS15, 0, 0), #attitude with respect to NED frame, as Euler angles
    ω_wb_b = zeros(3), #angular velocity with respect to local tangent frame, aircraft frame coordinates
    v_eb_n = zeros(3), #Earth-relative velocity, NED frame coordinates
    ) |> C172.Init
nothing # hide
```

Then, we assign it as:
```@example ex01
Sim.init!(sim, init_gnd)
```

### Running the Simulation

Now we can finally start the simulation:
```julia
Sim.run_interactive!(sim)
```

After a few seconds, the simulation will launch, and a new OS window containing the built-in GUI
will open:

![Default GUI](gui_default.png)

The *Simulation Control* panel lets you pause or resume the simulation, and set its pace relative to
wall clock time. To abort the simulation, simply close the GUI window.

The other panel is specific to our simulated ```Model```. A complex ```Model``` like ours
comprises a hierarchy of components. Each component is itself a ```Model```, and it typically
defines its own GUI panel, which can be accessed from that of its parent. Feel free to explore the
GUI to get a picture of the underlying component hierarchy and discover different ways of
interacting with the simulation.

!!! tip "GUI State"

    GUI panels can be moved, resized, tiled, docked or grouped as tabs. Try to find the layout that works
    best for you. GUI state is saved in a file named **imgui.ini**, which is automatically created in
    the project's root folder.  Deleting this file will restore the GUI to its default state.

Let's get back to X-Plane for a moment. You should now see the aircraft sitting on the runway *with
the engine stopped*. This indicates that the X-Plane interface was set up properly and our
simulation has taken control of the visuals.

![X-Plane 12 Simulation Started](xp12_sim_start.png)

!!! note "X-Plane 12 Demo Time Limit"

    The X-Plane 12 demo is time-limited to 15 minutes. After that, an on-screen pop-up will appear. To
    get rid of it, you can restart X-Plane and click on *Resume Last Flight*. You will then need to
    abort the simulation, reset it and run it again:

    ```julia
    Sim.init!(sim, init_gnd)
    Sim.run_interactive!(sim)
    ```

Now return to the GUI and navigate to *Aircraft > Avionics > Flight Control*. This panel contains
all the flight control inputs and instrumentation for the ```Cessna172Xv1``` model.

First, locate the *Engine Start* button under the *Engine* section. Press and hold it for a couple
of seconds to start the engine.

Next, expand the *Longitudinal Control Channel* and *Lateral Control Channel* sections. The first
one computes throttle and elevator commands. The second one computes aileron and rudder commands.
Both are initialized in *Direct* mode, wherein each actuator command is set directly to the sum of
its corresponding *Axis* and *Offset* values. With *Direct* mode active on both channels, you are
essentially flying the base Cessna 172S model, except for the additional actuator dynamics.

Try moving the control surfaces using the *Axis* and *Offset* inputs, and observe the result on the
GUI's numerical displays or an external X-Plane camera. When you are done, reset all values back to
zero.

!!! note "Joystick Override"

    If you have a joystick attached, the *Axis* sliders will be overridden
    by the corresponding joystick axes.

!!! tip "Keyboard Input"

    To assign a precise value to a control slider, use Ctrl+Click (on Windows)
    or Cmd+click (on Mac) to enable keyboard input.

Under *Longitudinal Control*, select the *Pitch SAS* mode. In this mode, direct throttle
control is preserved, but elevator inputs are fed to a pitch compensator, which computes the actual
elevator actuator commands. The pitch compensator modifies the natural short-period and phugoid
modes, providing a smoother, more stable pitch response. When clicked, the button will turn amber,
indicating the mode is now on standby; it will engage automatically upon lift off.

Under *Lateral Control*, select the *Roll/Yaw SAS* mode. In this mode, both aileron and rudder
inputs are fed to a lateral compensator, which simultaneously computes aileron and rudder actuator
commands. This improves the aircraft's Dutch roll response and stabilizes its naturally unstable
spiral mode.

Currently, the GUI does not have a graphical instrument panel. Instead, the *Flight Data* section
provides readouts for all essential variables. This will be particularly useful if you're running
this example without X-Plane.

![Take-Off GUI](gui_take_off.png)

That is all we really need to set up for take off. We won't bother with flap settings, rotation or
even keeping the aircraft centered on the runway (which, as far as our simulation is concerned,
doesn't really exist!). When you're ready, just set the *Throttle Axis* all the way to 1 and let
the aircraft accelerate and lift off on its own.

Once airborne, you will see the previously selected SAS modes turn from amber to green. Let the
aircraft climb for a while to give yourself some clearance. Then, spend some time flying with the
SAS modes enabled. When you feel comfortable with the controls, try switching back and forth between
the *Direct* and *Pitch SAS* modes, and compare the aircraft's response to elevator input. You can
do the same with the *Direct* and *Roll/Yaw SAS* modes to compare aileron and rudder responses, but
mind the spiral mode instability!

!!! tip "Crash Recovery"

    If a crash is detected, the landing gear model will throw an exception and the simulation will
    abort. No problem, just reset it and have another go:
    ```julia
    Sim.init!(sim, init_gnd)
    Sim.run_interactive!(sim)
    ```

Next, try the *EAS + Pitch Rate* mode. This mode combines an autothrottle loop with a pitch rate
loop built on top of the pitch SAS. Activating this mode will disable all *Throttle* and *Elevator*
inputs and enable the *EAS* and *Pitch Rate* commands. The numerical readout to the right of each
command slider shows the current value of its target variable. Try changing the *EAS* command and
observe the response. Then, experiment with the *Pitch Rate* command. While doing so, keep in mind
that an arbitrary pitch rate cannot be sustained indefinitely!

!!! note "Mode Transitions"

    When a new autopilot mode is engaged, its command variables are automatically set to their current
    values to provide a smooth transition. The exception are *Pitch Rate* and *Roll Rate* commands,
    which are always initialized to zero.

When you are done, enable the *EAS + Climb Rate* mode. Set the *EAS* command to 50 m/s and the
*Climb Rate* command to zero. This will hold your altitude throughout the next steps.

If you have attempted any turns so far, you may have noticed that the *Roll/Yaw SAS* mode does not
provide automatic turn compensation. For this, you can use one of the higher level lateral modes,
all of which track sideslip angle commands. Go ahead and enable the *Bank Angle + Sideslip* mode.
Set the *Sideslip Angle* command to zero. Then, initiate a turn with the *Bank Angle* command, and
notice how the sideslip angle is indeed held during the turn.

Finally, enable the *Course Angle + Sideslip* mode. Set the *Course Angle* to 0 and let the aircraft
turn to intercept it. Then, open the *Atmosphere > Wind* panel. Use the *East* slider to add some
crosswind. Notice how the aircraft turns into the wind, settling on the appropriate heading to
maintain the commanded course angle, while also tracking the commanded sideslip angle.

![Course Tracking GUI](gui_course.png)

One final suggestion before wrapping up. If the whole take-off sequence starts getting tedious, you
can skip it entirely by using the trim functionality to initialize the aircraft in flight. Here's
how to do it:
```@example ex01
init_air = C172.TrimParameters(;
    Ob = Geographic(loc_LOWS15, h_LOWS15 + 500), #500 m above runway 15
    EAS = 50.0, #equivalent airspeed (m/s)
    ψ_nb = ψ_LOWS15, #runway heading (rad)
    γ_wb_n = 0.0, #wind-relative flight path angle (rad)
    ψ_wb_dot = 0.0, #turn rate (rad/s)
    flaps = 0.0, #flaps position (0 to 1)
    fuel_load = 0.5, #normalized fuel load (0 to 1)
)
Sim.init!(sim, init_air)
```
