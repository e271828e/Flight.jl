# Interactive Aircraft Simulation

This example shows how to set up and run an interactive aircraft simulation. You will be able to
control the simulation through the built-in GUI and, optionally, use the free X-Plane 12 demo for 3D
visualization.

!!! warning "Initializing Julia for Multithreading"

    When running an interactive simulation, ```Flight.jl``` uses multithreading to concurrently handle the simulation loop, the built-in GUI
    and any attached I/O devices. Therefore, to work through this example, you will need to start Julia
    with multiple threads enabled. You can learn how to do this in the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/), but if you are using the
    Julia extension for VS Code, the easiest way is to add an entry like this to your ```settings.json```:

    ```json
    "julia.additionalArgs": [
        "--threads=auto",
    ],
    ```

    The ```auto``` setting will work well for most CPUs and use cases.

```@repl
using Flight
```

### Setting Up X-Plane 12

!!! note "Running Without X-Plane"

    If you can't run X-Plane 12, everything will still work fine, but your visuals will be limited to the built-in GUI.

<!-- Along the way, we will briefly introduce/touch upon some key concepts in the Flight.jl package. -->
