# Interactive Simulation

This example shows how to set up and run an interactive aircraft simulation. You will be able to
control it through the built-in GUI and, optionally, use the free X-Plane 12 demo for 3D
visualization.

!!! warning "Configuring Julia for Multithreading"

    When running an interactive simulation, ```Flight.jl``` uses multithreading to concurrently handle
    the simulation loop, the built-in GUI and any attached I/O devices. Therefore, to work through this
    example you will need to start Julia with multiple threads enabled. You can find out how to do this in
    the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/). However, if you are using the
    Julia extension for VS Code, the easiest way is to add the following entry to your
    ```settings.json``` (the ```auto``` setting will work well for most modern CPUs):

    ```json
    "julia.additionalArgs": [
        "--threads=auto",
    ],
    ```

### Setting Up X-Plane 12

Download, install and run the [X-Plane 12 demo](https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/try-it/). If you
happen to have the full version, you can use it instead. Since we will be using X-Plane simply as an
external visualization tool, we only need to set up a few things; for further help, check out the
[X-Plane 12 manual](https://www.x-plane.com/manuals/desktop/).

!!! note

    If you can't run X-Plane 12 (which might happen for instance if you have an Intel integrated
    graphics chip), you can skip this section. Your visuals will be limited to the built-in GUI, but
    everything else should still work.

From the main menu, click on *New Flight*. Select the Cessna Skyhawk as your aircraft and Salzburg
(LOWS) as your initial location. Start the flight.

To switch to an external camera, press Shift+4. Right click and drag to rotate the view and
use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. To return to the cockpit camera, press Shift+0.

![X-Plane 12 Settings Icon](xp12_settings_icon.png)

Move the mouse to the top of the screen to bring up the menu bar. Click on the *Settings* icon and
go the *Network* tab. Make sure *Accept incoming connections* is enabled. Then, under the *UDP
Ports* section, check the *Port we receive on (legacy)* value. The default is 49000, but you can use
a different one if you need to. Finally, if you are running X-Plane on a different machine than your
Julia session, note its IP address.

Now go to the *Graphics* tab. Unless you have a multi-monitor setup, you will probably want to run
X-Plane in windowed mode. This will allow you to keep it on screen along with the ```Flight.jl```
built-in GUI. To enable windowed mode, select *Windowed Simulator* in the *Monitor usage* drop-down.

You might also want to experiment with the quality settings until you achieve a comfortable
framerate. To display the framerate on screen, go to the *Data Output* tab, find the *Framerate*
entry in the table and enable the *Show in cockpit* option.

We are done setting up X-Plane, now let's move on to Julia.


### Setting Up the ```Flight.jl``` Simulation

Let's begin by initializing the package:
```@repl ex01
using Flight
```

Next, let's define the 2D location and orthometric elevation for the beginning of Salzburg airport's
runway 15, and the runway's geographic heading:
```@repl ex01
loc_LOWS15 = LatLon(ϕ = deg2rad(47.80433), λ = deg2rad(12.997))
h_LOWS15 = HOrth(427.2)
ψ_LOWS15 = deg2rad(157)
```

!!! note

    These values will result in X-Plane displaying the aircraft properly positioned and aligned
    on the runway centerline at the beginning of the simulation. However, this is just for appearance,
    since our physics model is completely independent from X-Plane's terrain mesh. This disconnect will
    become apparent as soon as the aircraft starts rolling down the runway.

Our simulated world will consist of an aircraft model, an atmospheric model, and a terrain model:

```@repl ex01
aircraft = Cessna172Xv1()
atmosphere = SimpleAtmosphere() #basic ISA-based model with adjustable sea-level conditions and wind velocity
terrain = HorizontalTerrain(altitude = h_LOWS15) #flat terrain model with constant orthometric elevation
world = SimpleWorld(aircraft, atmosphere, terrain)
```

The ```Cessna172Xv1``` aircraft is a hypothetical customization of a Cessna 172S. It replaces the
reversible actuation system on the base model with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system,
which we will leverage in this example. Note that this aircraft does not aim to replicate the
internals or interface of any specific real-world autopilot. Its main purpose is simply to
illustrate how the ```Flight.jl``` framework can be used to design, implement and test advanced control architectures.

We can now create the simulation itself. We'll specify reasonable values for the integration step
size and simulation length:
<!-- ```@repl ex01
sim = Simulation(world; dt = 0.01, t_end = 1000)
```
-->


Now attach an XPlane12Output. Explain what it does. Controls XPlane via UDP. Disables X-Plane's
physics on initialization. During simulation, it will periodically send our aircraft's state to XPlane
