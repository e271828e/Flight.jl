# Interactive Simulation

This example shows how to set up and run an interactive aircraft simulation. You will be able to
control it through the built-in GUI and, optionally, use the free X-Plane 12 demo for 3D
visualization.

!!! warning "Configuring Julia for Multithreading"

    When running an interactive simulation, ```Flight.jl``` uses multithreading to concurrently handle
    the simulation loop, the built-in GUI and any attached I/O devices. Therefore, to work through this
    example you will need to start Julia with multiple threads enabled. You can find out how to do this in
    the [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/). However, if you are using the
    Julia extension for VS Code, the easiest way is to add the following entry to your
    ```settings.json``` (the ```auto``` setting will work well for most CPUs and use cases):

    ```json
    "julia.additionalArgs": [
        "--threads=auto",
    ],
    ```

### Configuring X-Plane 12

Install and launch the [X-Plane 12 demo](https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/try-it/). If you happen to
have the full version, you can use it instead.

!!! note

    If you can't run X-Plane 12 (for instance, if your computer has an Intel integrated graphics chip),
    you may skip this section. Everything else in the example should still work, but your visuals
    will be limited to the built-in ```Flight.jl``` GUI.

From the main menu, go to *Settings > Network*. Make sure *Accept incoming connections* is enabled.
Then, under the *UDP Ports* section, check the *Port we receive on (legacy)* value. The default is
49000, but you can use a different one if you need to. Finally, if you are running X-Plane on a
different machine than your Julia session, you should note its IP address.

Unless you have a multi-monitor setup, you will likely want to run X-Plane in windowed mode. This
will allow you to have it on screen along with the built-in ```Flight.jl``` GUI. To
enable windowed mode, go to *Settings > Graphics* and, in *Monitor usage*, select *Windowed
Simulator*.

Go back to the main menu and click on *New Flight*. Select the Cessna Skyhawk and set Salzburg
(LOWS) as your location. Start the flight.

!!! note

    The X-Plane 12 demo is time-limited to 15 minutes. After that, an on-screen pop-up will appear. If
    you want it gone, you can restart X-Plane and click on *Resume Last Flight*. You will then need to
    abort the Julia simulation and run it again (we will see how to do this shortly).

Once X-Plane is done loading, you might want to return to *Settings > Graphics* and experiment with
the quality settings until you get a reasonable framerate. Unless you have a discrete GPU, you will
likely need to turn the quality way down. To display the simulation framerate, you can go to
*Settings > Data Output*, find the *Framerate* entry in the available outputs and click the *Show in
cockpit* checkbox.

Now we are done configuring X-Plane, let's set up our simulation in Julia.


### Setting Up the Simulation

Let's begin by initializing the package.
```@repl
using Flight
```

Salzburg is one of the areas included with the X-Plane 12 demo, so we will use that.

Create aircraft. SystemDescriptor. We are not into the details in this example. Explain what
Cessna172Xv1 is

Explain what XPlane12Output does.

The ```FlightCore.Joysticks``` module provides a joystick interface layer via [SDL2_jll]
(https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/SDL2_jll.jl). Currently, Thrustmaster's T.16000M is the only
supported model. Adding support for other joystick models is relatively straightforward, but we will
not be getting into it here. If you happen to have a T.16000M at your disposal, you can
plug it in and do the following:

Otherwise, don't worry. In this example, the SAS and autopilot modes will do most of the flying for
us, so you can easily control the aircraft through the GUI.

!!! note "X-Plane UDP Settings"

    By default, the ```XPlane12Output``` constructor assumes X-Plane 12 is running on your local machine
    and listening on port 49000. If this is not the case, you should provide the appropriate IP address
    and port via keyword arguments. For example:

    ```@repl
    using Flight
    using Sockets #bring IPv4 into scope
    xp = XPlane12Output(address = IPv4("192.168.1.2"), port = 49001)
    ```

<!-- Along the way, we will briefly introduce/touch upon some key concepts in the Flight.jl package. -->
